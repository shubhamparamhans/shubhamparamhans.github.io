  <h1>Fooling the Startup of the Year</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">Hacking into Ola Wallet — by Shubham Paramhans</div>

  <p>
    A few weeks ago I was working on some weekend fun project… I exactly don’t remember
    what that was. I was monitoring my phone traffic from a proxy server. While doing that
    I saw Ola API calls going from my phone (since I was booking a cab).
  </p>

  <p>
    For those who don’t know about Ola, Ola Cabs is the biggest cab provider in India and
    also the biggest competitor of Uber.
  </p>

  <p>
    After seeing those flashing binary data going from my system I forgot my weekend project
    and started tweaking and reverse engineering Ola API’s which eventually resulted in
    breaking their money transaction system and bam I was able to recharge my Ola wallet
    with any amount.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a long time I was thinking about publishing this work on the web but I have been
    way too busy all this time.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s innate in humans — We all love a story. And if you’re looking for a cool tech
    story, this one could be for you.
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter 0 — Something is Not Right</h2>

  <p>
    I was working on a small side project in which I was monitoring my phone traffic using
    <strong>MITM Proxy</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    While booking a cab using Ola I saw their API calls going from my phone to Ola servers.
    I was amazed to see that all the requests were simple HTTP requests and not even encrypted.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was also surprised to see that there was no OAuth token mechanism or any other security
    mechanism being used in the API calls.
  </p>

  <p>
    This made it very easy to replicate the API calls using tools like Postman or even
    Google Chrome.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started playing with the API calls and was able to fetch all cabs near my location.
  </p>

  <p>
    At that point I was sure that something is not right here.
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter 1 — Digging the Tunnel</h2>

  <p>
    After fetching cabs data successfully I thought what else can I do with these APIs.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started thinking about creating a simple app which would book a cab automatically
    for me whenever I want. Something like — I just open the app and it books a cab for me
    with all my preferences set.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started building that app and was able to book cabs successfully using Ola APIs.
  </p>

  <p>
    After that, a crazy thought came into my mind — <em>what if I could book cabs for free?</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    That was the moment when I started tracking Ola wallet recharge API calls.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started monitoring the recharge process carefully and tried to understand the
    complete flow of money transaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    After some observation I found that the complete wallet recharge process consisted of
    three simple steps:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Generating an order id</li>
    <li>Making payment gateway calls</li>
    <li>Sending acknowledgement of transaction to Ola servers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    All these API calls were simple HTTP requests and data was being sent in plain text.
  </p>

  <p>
    This made it extremely easy to analyze and replicate the requests.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started digging deeper into the APIs to understand how order ids were generated and
    how Ola was validating successful transactions.
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter 2 — Fire in the Hole</h2>

  <p>
    After understanding the complete flow of wallet recharge process, I decided to try it
    out practically.
  </p>

  <p>
    I generated an order id using Ola API and then skipped the payment gateway step completely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of making the payment, I directly sent the transaction acknowledgement request
    to Ola servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    To my surprise, the wallet recharge was successful.
  </p>

  <p>
    I received an SMS saying that my Ola wallet has been recharged.
  </p>

  <p>
    At first I thought it could be a one-time thing or maybe a glitch.
  </p>

  <p>
    So I tried the same thing again.
  </p>

  <p>
    And again.
  </p>

  <p>
    And again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every single time, the wallet was getting recharged successfully.
  </p>

  <p>
    I then realized that Ola servers were not validating whether the order id was already
    used or not.
  </p>

  <p>
    The same order id could be reused multiple times to recharge the wallet.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was a critical flaw in their transaction system.
  </p>

  <p>
    At that point I stopped experimenting further because things were already going out
    of control.
  </p>

  <h2>The Aftermath</h2>

  <p>
    After realizing how serious the issue was, I decided to stop experimenting further.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am an ethical hacker and I believe in responsible disclosure, so I mailed Ola about
    the bug and explained the complete issue to them.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also asked them whether they had any bug bounty program.
  </p>

  <p>
    Initially, the response I got was very disappointing.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was asked to explain the issue again and again to different people from their support
    team.
  </p>

  <p>
    After a few follow-ups, someone from their technical team finally acknowledged the
    issue and told me that they will fix it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I waited for a long time but there was no fix deployed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The bug stayed live for weeks.
  </p>

  <p>
    This made me realize how seriously some startups take security — even when money is
    involved.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    This whole incident taught me a very important lesson.
  </p>

  <p>
    No matter how big or well-funded a startup is, if the core architecture is weak, it
    can easily be exploited.
  </p>

  <p>Some of the major issues in Ola’s system were:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>No authentication or encryption on critical APIs</li>
    <li>No server-side validation of order ids</li>
    <li>Blind trust on client-side transaction acknowledgements</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Security should never be an afterthought — especially when financial transactions
    are involved.
